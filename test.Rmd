## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(flextable)
fac.vars <- c('Session','Number','Gender')

rawdata <- import('D_YH_Behavior.xlsx',sheet='rawdata',as = 'dt')[
  # if LHS has multiple col names , should add ()
  , (fac.vars):= lapply(.SD,as.factor),.SDcols = fac.vars][
    ,Gender:=fct_recode(Gender,'Male' = '1','Female'= '2')][
      .(Session = as.character(1:5) ,to = c('base','pre_Q','post_Q','pre_dance','post_dance')),
      on = 'Session',Label := i.to ]
subject <- rawdata[,.(number = .(Number)),by = .(Label,Gender)][,.SD,Gender][
  , c("quit", "keep", "newadd"):=
    transpose(map2(number,dplyr::lag(number),\(x,y)
                   list( setdiff(y, x), #quit
                         intersect(x, y), #same
                         setdiff(x, y)) )),by = Gender] 
(sub_number <- subject[ ,map(.SD,\(x) map_int(x,length)),by = .(Label,Gender)])


sub_number %>% df_printer()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
